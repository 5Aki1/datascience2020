## Points of Reflection

- What advantages are there for data scientists if there is a single data structure like the ${\tt tibble}$?

- Do a bit of archaelogy and figure out what this ancient ${\tt data.frame}$ is.

- Would science be better served if there were more standardized ways of making data and metadata available?
