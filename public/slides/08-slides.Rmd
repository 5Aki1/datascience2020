## Plan for Today

- Check out my Youtube channel for classic [Survivorman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNxro4Nn_Ok).

- Today I will be stranded on a desert island in the fierce conditions of the south pacific ocean.

- With nothing but my Arc'teryx jacket and a single RSTudio Cloud license;

- I will seek to survive the incredible sunny days, really salty water, and relentless sand 

- ... suriving on nothing more than microbes that I wrangled into my ${\tt tibble}$.

- It might seem easy but a week without that special tea from Indonesia of questionable legality  which my grad student keeps giving me, and you are dead.

## Our attempt to harvest Tara Oceans data 

- ... and wrangle it into our RStudio session.

- [Tara Oceans](https://oceans.taraexpeditions.org/en/)  

- [Sunagawa et al. (2015) Structure and function of the global ocean microbiome. Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/1261359.long)

- This one is where we will start our survival expedition [Sunagawa et al. (2015) Supplemental Data](http://ocean-microbiome.embl.de/companion.html)
